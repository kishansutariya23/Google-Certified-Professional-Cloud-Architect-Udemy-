- Different Computing Services
    - Compute Engine (VM)
    - Kuberbetes Engine
    - APP Engine
    - Cloud Function
- Computing Services
    - VM
        - Server in cloud with auto scaling, full control of OS
    - Code & Container
        - Container orchestration, deploy code
        - in build auto scaling and load balancing
    - Serverless
        - NO OPS env. Mostly you don't want to manage any H/W resources
## [üöè] - paste the pic of piramid

- Control over infrastructure & direct access to network/ other compute resources
- Req. Cant be easily containerized it use existing VM images
- Host Application without rewriting it.
- Applications needs OS-level changes
- over all inshort
    - VM in cloud....same like your server
    - You can deploy applications....Run Backend jobs.. scripts, Data Processing... etc.
    - You can have your own software running in your data center server
    - Full control over hardware... OS Customizations
    - Its your own server in GCP ... but virtual
    - You can rent full server box
