There are three CORE SERVICES
- [Computing Platform](../5.Compute%20Services/)
- [Networking](../8.Networking/)
-  [Database & Storage](../6.Storage_and_Database/) 

Data and storage is one of them
- Relational Databases :- MYSQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server
- No SQL :- Hadoop, DynamoDB, MongoDB, Spark, Cassandra, Objects & File Storage etc.,..

in google we have [Data & AI Services]() solution
- Data & Storage
    - Database :- SQL, NOSQL, Object Storage
- BigData 
    - Hadoop, Spark, Apache Bean ...
- AI
    - ML, Speech, Vision, NL, Translation ...
----
## Data & Storage
- Cloud SQL
- Cloud Spanner (google own)
- Cloud BIGTABLE (hbase)
- Cloud DataStore (mongodb type)
- Cloud Storage (object type)

## BigData Services
- Cloud BigQuery
- Cloud Dataflow
- Cloud DataPROC
- Cloud DataLAB
- Cloud PUB/SUB
------------------------------------------
#  Cloud SQL
- It is RDBMS
- Fully managed MYSQL & PostgreSQL RDBMS
    - NO need to install any VM or setup the DB just do some configuration and you are ready to start your work.

- 
- give details and start working.
- You can go with [documentation for SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/)
    - MYSQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server.



## Performance
- performance means cpu, gpu, mb/s, read and write speed, storage, network(mb/s)
- changing machine type and instances based on the requirement(cpu, storage, gpu)
- HDD or SDD should be select in early stage and can't be changed after creation
- Auto increase in the size of storage
## Backups and Restore
## Logging and Point in time recovery
## High Availability
## Read Replica
## Pricing
## Cleanup
