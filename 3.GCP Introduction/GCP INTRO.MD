    - [Region, Zones Data Centers](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations)
        - Region
            - Independent Geographic area that consist of Zone. Main purpose is to host applications near to your users to reduce Latency and Availability, Durability.
        - Zones
            - Physical Locations inside Regions. It provides geo redundancy. Used Mainly for High Availability inside Region.
        - ex:- Assume Region is india && Zones are mumbai, delhi

        - we can create the alert for the project and we will get alert trigger/notification when we reach the threshold limit.
    - Quota and Limits
        - IAM--->QUOTAS
        - Quotas
            - **it defines limits per resources**
            - there are different types of quotas depends on type of resources
            - defines as global or regional quotas
            - benefit
                - controls budget
                - limit resources utilizations on different levels
                - you can increase any time with console request
        - ALL resources are subject to project quotas & limits
            - how many resources you can create per project
            - how quickly you can make API request in project - rate limit
            - some quota application to region/zone
        - we can increase the quota through self service form
        - no. of GPUs
        - 32 CPUs per region
        - LIMITS
            - hard limits which we can not extend
            - we can say this is the way system is designed
            - ex:- 15500 VMs in VPC AND 5 NETWORKS/vpc PER PROJECTS
    - Service Account
        - IAM--> Service account
        - **it is used for application to application access/communication**
        - we can provide the role for such accounts
        - let us assume we create new VM and we will make it as face of some application and then we will make integration between bucket(similar to s3 in AWS) and VM so that all the content which is available in the bucket is displayed/accessed by VM based on the role assigned to the service account.
        - fine grained control on which application do what
        - used based on secure token(access key-id)
        - 3 types of service accounts in nutshell
            - you can create service account
            - built-in for virtual machines and APP engine
            - used by goggle API internally.
